Responsive-Resume
=================

My responsive resume that I use to apply for jobs.

------

Hello! Are you applying for jobs and you feel like paper (or just PDFs) don't quite do the trick? Try making a responsive resume. I created this resume originally in November of 2012 when applying for a internship. It was a wonderful way to learn coding responsively. I am putting this out there so everyone can easily have a responsive resume. Play around with it. Make your own (you obviously are not Chelsea Myers).
